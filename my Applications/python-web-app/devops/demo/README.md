# Deplyoing The DJANGO application in Docker container
### Django:
Django is the Python web framework. If so, Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern and includes features such as an object-relational mapper (ORM), a URL routing system, a template engine, and a form handling library. Django is widely used for building web applications.

 Actually we write a simple  python code in views.py folder and wrote a html file in demo_site.html that is displayed in frontend.
 ## Explanation for views.py folder

 This code snippet defines a Django view, which is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. Let's break down the code:

1. `from django.http import HttpResponse`: This imports the `HttpResponse` class from the `django.http` module. `HttpResponse` is a class used to create HTTP responses.

2. `from django.shortcuts import render`: This imports the `render` function from the `django.shortcuts` module. The `render` function is a shortcut method for loading a template, rendering it with a context, and returning an `HttpResponse` object with the rendered content.

3. `def index(request):`: This defines a view function called `index` that takes a `request` object as its argument. The `request` object represents the HTTP request from the client.

4. `return render(request, 'demo_site.html')`: This line uses the `render` function to render the `demo_site.html` template with an optional context (not provided in this example) and returns the result as an `HttpResponse` object. The `request` argument is passed to the `render` function to provide context information, such as the request's user, session, and other metadata.

In summary, this code defines a Django view function called `index` that renders the `demo_site.html` template and returns the rendered content as an HTTP response.
