# Deplyoing The DJANGO application in Docker container
### Django:
Django is the Python web framework. If so, Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern and includes features such as an object-relational mapper (ORM), a URL routing system, a template engine, and a form handling library. Django is widely used for building web applications.
